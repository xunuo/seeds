Hi! I'm Amit. Learning how to develop Android apps is very exciting.

2
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:08,250
We assume that you have little or no programming experience.

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:13,330
You'll start with the very basics and move to more intermediate and advanced topics.

4
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:20,020
You will get off to a quick start by building a simple Crystal Ball app which will teach you how to use Eclipse,

5
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,090
the recommended tool to create android apps,

6
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:28,800
and you will also learn how to use Java, the programming language to write android apps.

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,240
Finally, you will learn how to publish your app to Google Play and the Amazon app store.

8
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:42,100
Next, we'll increase the complexity by building an app that downloads and displays blogposts from the Treehouse blog.

9
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:46,470
This project will teach you the design pattern known as model view controller,

10
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:50,360
how to display a list of data, and how to show a webpage.

11
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:55,050
You will also learn how to share text with your friends right from within the app.

12
00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:03,400
By the end, you will be comfortable building a fairly complex android app as well as know where to go to continue with your learning.

13
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,910
So join us and good luck!
